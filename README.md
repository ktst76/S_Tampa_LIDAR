# Introduction
South Tampa also known as the Interbay peninsula, is a long (14 km / 8.6 miles) narrow (4 km / 2.5 miles), highly urbanized area with Tampa Bay shoreline on three sides (E,S,W).  Tampa and the surrounding area lie in a zone of often heavy summer (June-September) precipitation, that combined with limited vertical relief can rapidly overwhelm natural drainage and municipal services (sewer, stormwater, etc).  In addition to the heavy summer precipitation, Atlantic hurricanes are a potential threat for both heavy precipitation and storm surge.  Finally, sea levels will rise as a result of anthropogenic climate change, reducing the already limited vertical relief; or an even flatter South Tampa.

# Driving Factor
During the summer of 2015 the Tampa area received heavy rainfall compared to seasonal averages; the author's calibrated backyard rain-gauge recorded 46.61 inches (118.4 cm) of rain from June 1st until August 31st, an amount equal to 211% of average during the period.  In addition to the well above average volume of precipitation, rain often fell in heavy spells lasting two to three days, June and August saw events with greater than 6 inches (15 cm) of precipitation in 48 hours.  This heavy rainfall, saturated soils and limited vertical relief resulted in large areas of South Tampa flooding.  Streets that were passable, rapidly became unpassable, with little visible indication why street X is flooded, but street Y is merely wet.  The images below highlight surface flooding on August 1st, the first image looks east (the Tampa Bay shoreline is 0.6 mile / 1 km down the street) while the second image looks west.
